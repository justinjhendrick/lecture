## Reading questions

1.  A given program spends 10% of its time in an initial startup
    phase, and then 90% of its time in work that can be easily
    parallelized.  Assuming a machine with homogeneous cores, plot the
    idealized speedup and parallel efficiency of the overall code
    according to Amdahl's law for up to 128 cores.  If you know how,
    you should use a script to produce this plot, with both the serial
    fraction and the maximum number of cores as parameters.

2.  Suppose a particular program can be partitioned into perfectly
    independent tasks, each of which takes time tau.  Tasks are
    set up, scheduled, and communicated to p workers at a (serial)
    central server; this takes an overhead time alpha per task.
    What is the theoretically achievable throughput (tasks/time)?

    time = alpha * tasks
    tasks / time = 1 / alpha

3.  Under what circumstances is it best to not tune?

    If it's only run once, if you're not tuning a bottleneck, or
    if the amount of human time it takes to tune it is not worth
    the computer time saved

4.  The class cluster consists of eight nodes and fifteen Xeon Phi
    accelerator boards.  Based on an online search for information on
    these systems, what do you think is the theoretical peak flop rate
    (double-precision floating point operations per second)?  Show how
    you computed this, and give URLs for where you got the parameters
    in your calculation.  (We will return to this question again after
    we cover some computer architecture.)

    HOST NODES:
    [1] states the clock frequency of the host nodes at 2.4 GHz
    2 flops/FMA
    x4 FMA/vectorFMA = 8 flops/vector FMA
    x2 vector FMAs/cycle = 16 flops/cycle
    and each thread performs 2.4 * 16 = 38.4 gigaFLOP/s.
    So, that is 8 * 12 * 38.4 = 3.7 teraFLOP/s.

    ACCELERATORS:
    There are 15 accelerators each with 60 cores and a clock speed of 1.053 GHz, according
    to [3]. So, 4 * 1.053 * 60 * 15 = 3790.8 gigaFLOP/s.

    TOTAL: 
    7.5 teraFLOP/s.

5.  What is the approximate theoretical peak flop rate for your own machine?

    I have a first generation Intel i3 processor with 4 cores each with
    a clock speed of 933 MHz.
    4 * 933 * 4 = 14.9 gigaFLOP/s
