## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?

    a + t * (n / r) + s * r
    where a is the amount of time to explain the protocol
    and t is the amount of time to count one student
    and n is the total number of students
    and r is the number of rows
    and s is the amount of time for the instructor to retrieve a value and add

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?

    t * n
    where t is time to count one student and
    n is the total number of students

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?

    a + t * (n / r) + s * r = t * n
    a/t + n/r + sr/t = n
    a/t + sr/t = n - n/r

     a + sr
    ---------- = n
     t - t/r
